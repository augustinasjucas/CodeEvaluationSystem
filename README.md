# SistemaAA
VALIO!

To download all the node_modules:

cd SistemaAA
npm install
cd client && npm install && npm run build


To start the server:
cd SistemaAA
npm start

To start the client:
cd SistemaAA
cd client && npm start


Then the client will be on localhost:3000 and the server on localhost:3001

Also, when deploying this project, certain lines will have to be uncommented in order for the
client to be on the same domain as the server.
